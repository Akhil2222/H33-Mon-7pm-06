    <h1 class='text-center'>About me</h1>
    <p class='text-center'>I am Akhil, a programmer who is very lazy. I code, do math at times, and play video games (usually Cookie Run: Kingdom). My favorite language to code with is JavaScript, because Python indentation is very annoying. A lot of my games are simple to play and make, and some were made 4 years ago. Below is a link to all of my published games.</p>
